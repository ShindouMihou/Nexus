# Addons

In order to keep the repository specific to the actual functionalities of the Nexus features, 
other cool things that would  be nice to have in Nexus, such as confirmation menus, etc. are stored into different 
repositories and linked here through Git Submodule for others to see.

Here are the list of each different add-on that extends upon Nexus' features:
-  [`entour`](nexus.entour) is a set of handy built-in components, hooks and tools for Nexus.R. This contains many
different things for develoeprs who uses Nexus.R such as Confirmation Menus.
