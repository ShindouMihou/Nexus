# Addons

In order to keep the repository specific to the actual functionalities of the Nexus features, 
other cool things that would  be nice to have in Nexus, such as coroutines, etc. are stored into different 
repositories and linked here through Git Submodule for others to see.

Here are the list of each different add-on that extends upon Nexus' features:
- [`coroutines`](nexus.coroutines) adds coroutine support to the framework.
